This is a sample README file for my project.

## Description

This project will ask the user a series of questions using the inquirer package that when answered, will generate a README.md file for your project. It uses npm, inquirer and Node.js to do this.

## Installation

First, you need to clone the github repo. Then, in the same folder as "index.js", you need to run two commands: "npm i install" and "npm i inquirer". Then the project can be ran. If you need more help, watch this video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dt5qwxpV7_nUtbEjtsedF-s7KU6mVRAN/view 

## Usage

When its installed, you can run the project by running in the terminal: "node index.js", and then you can answer the prompts the console gives you.

## Testing

You can test this project, as said above, by running "node index.js" and after you answer the prompts, look at the README.md
